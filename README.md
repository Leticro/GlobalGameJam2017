# GlobalGameJam2017

Global Game Jam is a 48 hour event where various artists, designers, and programmers gather to develop a game in the
given 48 hour time frame. This year, the topic for the game was waves.

This is a game where you move a ball with waves by clicking to navigate through numerous levels of obstacle courses.

This was my first time attending a Global Game Jam as well as working with such a motivated group. I was shadowing Twig
as a Gameplay Programmer due to a lack of confidence in my current ability to be responsible for all the programming in
a game. My contribution includes implementing the jump mechanics, adding audio, and slightly adjusting camera angles.

This source code runs on the Unity game engine. An executable file of the game can be downloaded from the link above.
